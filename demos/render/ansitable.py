ansitable.py -- ANSI-aware table formatter for psql unaligned output.

Why this exists
---------------
psql's own ALIGNED formatter escapes 0x1B to the four-character text "\\x1B" and
then measures column widths from the escaped text. A cell carrying three
24-bit colour runs is therefore padded as if it were ~60 characters wider than
it draws, and every row with a different number of colour runs lands at a
different visible width. All three prototypes hit this independently; one
measured a 390-column border rule under a 100-column table.

So we ask psql for UNALIGNED output, which passes raw ESC bytes through
untouched (`psql -A -F <sep> -P footer=off`), and own the alignment here,
measuring DISPLAY width via render/dwidth.py.

Two jobs beyond alignment:

  * rstrip_cell -- ash.chart() right-pads its bar string to a constant
    length() as its own workaround for the same psql bug. We align on display
    width, so that padding is dead weight: it would inflate the still by ~70
    columns. Strip it, but keep any SGR bytes that were interleaved with it so
    the colour state machine stays balanced.

  * wrapping -- ash.summary() emits a 108-column `value` and ash.top('query_id')
    emits full statement text. Truncating would be editing the reader's output.
    Wrapping is what a terminal does, and it keeps every character. When the
    table exceeds --max-width, the widest column is folded and continuation
    lines are drawn with a dim gutter.

Input : psql -A -F $'\\x1f' -P footer=off  (header line + data lines)
Output: box-drawn table with real ESC codes preserved, LF endings.

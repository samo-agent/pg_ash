# lib/seed.sh — build a frozen incident window in a real PostgreSQL, fast.
#
# The trick, in one sentence: run real pgbench load, sample it with pg_ash's own
# ash.take_sample(), and then move the timestamps of the samples we just took
# into the virtual minute they represent. One real second of load becomes one
# virtual minute of history, so 28 minutes of believable ASH arrives in ~20
# seconds instead of ~28 real minutes.
#
# What is real: every sample, every wait event, every query id, every count.
# What is shaped: which samples exist, and when they are considered to have
# been taken. See the honesty boundary at the top of lib/seed.sql.
#
# The story the seeder tells, in virtual minutes:
#
#   1 .. 4    calm   read-only baseline    <- SLACK, outside the query window,
#                                             so the raw-retention guardrail in
#                                             the drill readers cannot trip as
#                                             the seed ages
#   5 .. 12   calm   read-only baseline    <- the compare() baseline window
#  13 .. 17   STORM  row-lock contention   <- the incident
#  18 .. 20   tail   mixed write recovery
#  21 .. 28   busy   read/IO load
#
# Exit codes: 3 backend, 4 seed assertion. (§2.6)

# calm baseline that is itself busy eats the whole margin. Measured on this
# hardware: 4 calm clients -> ~3 AAS, 12 storm clients -> ~15 peak AAS, so the
# ratio lands near 5x with room for a loaded machine.
# These numbers are also a PICTURE decision, not just a load decision.
# ash.chart() ranks its series by total AAS over the whole window, so a heavy
# calm phase does not merely look busy — it pushes both Lock waits out of the
# top four and the flagship chart draws the five-minute incident as an anonymous
# column of "Other" dots. Measured here: baseline at 4 clients gave a 3.7 AAS
# calm floor and CPU* outranked Lock:transactionid over the 24-minute window.
# At 3/4 clients the calm floor is ~2.5 and the storm owns the chart.
# lib/shape.sql assertion 7 fails the seed if this balance ever slips again.

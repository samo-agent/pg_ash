 * ===========================================================================
 * HONESTY BOUNDARY  (restated verbatim in demos/README.md)
 * ===========================================================================
 * The harness shapes WHICH real samples exist and WHEN they are considered to
 * have been taken. Every number in every asset is pg_ash aggregating its own
 * stored samples, written by ash.take_sample() from real pg_stat_activity over
 * real pgbench backends. No reader output is edited. The time compression
 * ratio (1 real second = 1 virtual minute) is stated in demos/README.md.
 * ASH_REAL_TIME=1 skips the restamp and runs in real time.
 *
 * Concretely, the only liberty taken is the UPDATE in ash_demo.restamp():
 * it rewrites ash.sample.sample_ts. It never invents a row, never edits an
 * active_count, and never touches the packed data[] array — the wait events
 * and query ids in every sample are exactly what pg_stat_activity reported.
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * Style note: this file follows the project SQL style guide (lower case
 * keywords, explicit aliases, no `select *` in shipped queries).

 * ash_demo.batch(n, delay)
 *
 * Take `n` real samples through pg_ash's own sampler, committing between each
 * so ash.take_sample() sees a fresh now() (it timestamps from transaction
 * start, not clock_timestamp) and so its transaction-level advisory lock is
 * released between ticks.
 *
 * The calling session is invisible to its own samples: take_sample() filters
 * `pid <> pg_backend_pid()`. That is what keeps the seeder out of the picture
 * and is why the harness must sample from exactly ONE session — a second
 * sampler shows up in the first one's data as Timeout:PgSleep and pollutes
 * the whole story.

 * ash_demo.restamp(watermark, base_ts, idx)

 * Move every sample written since `watermark` into virtual minute `idx`

 * across that minute's 60 seconds.
 *
 * `watermark` is the epoch-offset of clock_timestamp() taken immediately
 * BEFORE the batch. Every already-restamped row sits in the past (the seeded
 * window ends at the top of the current hour, always <= now), so
 * `sample_ts >= watermark` selects exactly the rows this batch wrote.
 *
 * Ordering is row_number() over (sample_ts, datid, active_count) — and it MUST
 * be row_number(), not dense_rank(). A tight sampling loop routinely fires
 * several ticks inside the same wall-clock second; dense_rank() collapses
 * those onto one virtual second, so the minute reports fewer distinct samples
 * than it holds backend counts for and AAS inflates by the sampling multiple.
 * A prototype hit exactly this and measured a 10x error.

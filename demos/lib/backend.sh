# lib/backend.sh — the only file in demos/ allowed to touch raw PG* variables.
#
# Three backends, one interface (§5):
#
#   local   DEFAULT and the CI path. Whatever cluster the ambient PG* variables
#           already reach. Needs psql + pgbench and nothing else: no Docker
#           daemon, no registry pull, no ALTER SYSTEM, no restart. pg_cron is
#           NOT required — the seeder drives ash.take_sample() itself, which is
#           both the portable path and the honest one, because that is exactly
#           how pg_ash runs on RDS / Cloud SQL / Supabase / AlloyDB / Neon.
#   docker  Optional. For pinning a specific major, or for a cluster that
#           really has pg_cron. Never on the critical path.
#   remote  Standard PG* variables against someone else's server, with two
#           guardrails that cannot be switched off.
#
# HOUSE RULES ARE ENFORCED HERE, IN CODE, NOT IN DOCUMENTATION. Every drop and
# every `docker rm` re-asserts the ash_demo* / ash_demo_* name globs and the
# ownership record this run wrote. A harness that can delete a database it did
# not create has no business running on anybody's laptop.

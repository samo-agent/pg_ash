# pg_ash 2.0 beta 1 release notes

2.0 beta 1 promotes the rewritten reader API from `devel/sql/` into the normal
release SQL path. Fresh installs use `\i sql/ash-install.sql`; upgrades from
1.5 use `\i sql/migrations/ash-1.5-to-2.0.sql` after applying any missing 1.x
migrations. Root-level `sql/ash-X.Y-to-A.B.sql` wrappers remain for
compatibility.

This is a breaking reader-API release. Sampling, storage, rollups, scheduler
functions, and lifecycle/admin functions remain compatible, but the 1.x reader
surface has been replaced by the AAS-oriented 2.0 API:

| 1.x | 2.0 |
|---|---|
| `top_waits`, `top_by_type` | `top('wait_event')`, `top('wait_event_type')` |
| `top_queries`, `top_queries_with_text` | `top('query_id')` |
| `wait_timeline` | `timeline(...)` |
| `timeline_chart` | `chart(...)` |
| `activity_summary` | `summary(...)` |
| `query_waits(q)` | `top('wait_event', query_id => q)` |
| `event_queries(e)` | `top('query_id', wait_event => e)` |
| `samples_by_database` | `top('database')` |

## 2.0 highlights

- **AAS-first readers.** `periods`, `aas`, `timeline`, `top`, `compare`,
  `samples`, `report`, `chart`, and `summary` use consistent named filters and
  report whether data came from raw samples, 1-minute rollups, or 1-hour rollups.
- **Machine-readable report.** `ash.report()` returns a stable JSONB payload for
  incident automation, dashboards, and AI/database copilots. The 2.0 minor line
  may add keys, but existing keys are not renamed or removed.
- **Upgrade convergence.** The 1.5-to-2.0 wrapper replays the finalized 2.0
  installer, removes stale 1.x and earlier draft reader functions, and preserves
  explicit reader grants where safe.
- **Default monitoring access.** Fresh installs and upgrades best-effort grant
  the reader bundle to `pg_monitor`; opt out with
  `select ash.revoke_reader('pg_monitor');`.
- **Postgres 19 beta support.** CI now covers Postgres 14 through 19, using the
  official `postgres:19beta1` image until the GA `postgres:19` image exists.
- **Docs refreshed.** README examples now use the 2.0 named-argument API.

Known security limitation: advisory-lock squat DoS remains possible for roles
that can intentionally hold pg_ash advisory locks. See
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#advisory-lock-squat-dos).

# pg_ash 1.5 release notes

This is a bug-fix release: no new user-facing feature set, just correctness,
safety, and release-process hardening. Upgrade from 1.4:
`\i sql/ash-1.4-to-1.5.sql`. Fresh install or upgrade from any version:
`\i sql/ash-install.sql`.

Thanks to @r314tive for the sustained bug-reporting work behind this release:
issues #81, #83, and #87-#91, plus the original PRs behind the rollup/rotation
and raw-retention fixes ([PR #86](https://github.com/NikolayS/pg_ash/pull/86),
[PR #85](https://github.com/NikolayS/pg_ash/pull/85)).

## Fixes

- **`wait_event_map` cap enforcement fixed.** `_register_wait()` now checks the exact 32 000th dictionary row instead of trusting stale `pg_class.reltuples`, so the hard cap fires immediately after `TRUNCATE` / restore and increments `register_wait_cap_hits` as documented. (issue #90; [PR #92](https://github.com/NikolayS/pg_ash/pull/92))
- **Raw samples are protected during rollup/rotation races.** `rollup_minute()` no longer advances its watermark while a sampler is in flight, and `rotate()` refuses to truncate an endangered raw partition unless pre-truncation rollup succeeds and covers the raw groups in that slot. (issue #81; [PR #86](https://github.com/NikolayS/pg_ash/pull/86))
- **Raw readers honor rebuilt partition retention.** `_active_slots_for()` and `_active_slots_for_at()` now enumerate every retained raw slot after `rebuild_partitions(N, 'yes')` instead of only current plus previous slot. (issue #83; [PR #85](https://github.com/NikolayS/pg_ash/pull/85))
- **pg_stat_statements readers ignore spoofed relations and avoid duplicate top-query rows.** pgss-aware readers now require the real `pg_stat_statements` extension before reading query text/metrics, and `top_queries*` aggregates pgss rows by `queryid` so one ASH query cannot fan out into multiple rows. (issue #87; [PR #97](https://github.com/NikolayS/pg_ash/pull/97))
- **`daily_peak_backends.avg_backends` now reports average active backends.** The value is derived from hourly backend-seconds divided by sample count instead of averaging hourly peak values. (issue #88; [PR #98](https://github.com/NikolayS/pg_ash/pull/98))
- **Reader and input-validation edge cases fixed.** `top_waits()` now treats `p_limit` as a hard output row limit including `Other`, zero timeline buckets raise explicit validation errors, `ash.start(NULL)` returns a clear error row, and `ash.grant_reader()` no longer grants EXECUTE on internal mutating helper `_register_wait()`. `ash.start()` also rejects fractional-second and oversized intervals without rounding or integer-overflow errors. (issues #91, #141; [PR #99](https://github.com/NikolayS/pg_ash/pull/99))
- **Malformed raw sample payloads are rejected.** `ash.sample.data` now uses a packed-array validator CHECK constraint, preventing rows whose declared wait count exceeds the available query-id payload from making raw readers report impossible totals. (issue #89; [PR #100](https://github.com/NikolayS/pg_ash/pull/100))

## Release process

- **Development SQL is staged outside released SQL.** Between releases, new SQL
  lives under `devel/sql/`; release stamping promotes it into `sql/` only when
  cutting the next tag. ([PR #94](https://github.com/NikolayS/pg_ash/pull/94))
- **CI discovers SQL chains from files.** The test workflow uses
  `devel/scripts/ash_sql_chain.py` instead of hardcoded version paths, so future
  version bumps require adding/moving files, not rewriting CI. ([PR #94](https://github.com/NikolayS/pg_ash/pull/94))

# pg_ash 1.4 release notes

38 commits since v1.3. Upgrade from 1.3: `\i sql/ash-1.3-to-1.4.sql`. Fresh install or upgrade from any version: `\i sql/ash-install.sql`. The upgrade script is idempotent and safe to re-run.

Reference style: bare issue refs are written as `issue #N`; implementation PR refs are written as `PR #N` and linked where a separate PR exists. Consolidation happened in [PR #76](https://github.com/NikolayS/pg_ash/pull/76).

## Breaking changes

### `rebuild_partitions()` now requires a `'yes'` confirmation token

`ash.rebuild_partitions(N)` drops every raw sample partition and is irreversible. To prevent accidental data loss, the function takes a second argument and refuses to proceed unless it equals `'yes'`. Wording mirrors `ash.uninstall('yes')`.

```sql
-- before: silently destructive
select ash.rebuild_partitions(9);

-- now: explicit confirmation required
select ash.rebuild_partitions(9, 'yes');
```

Calling `ash.rebuild_partitions(N)` without the `'yes'` token raises an error and changes nothing — `sampling_enabled`, pg_cron jobs, and partition tables are all left untouched. The argument-validation runs before any destructive action. (issue #53; [PR #59](https://github.com/NikolayS/pg_ash/pull/59))

## What's new

### Long-term storage: rollup tables

Two new tables — `ash.rollup_1m` (per-minute) and `ash.rollup_1h` (per-hour) — aggregate raw samples into compact summaries that survive raw-partition rotation. Watermark-based functions populate them:

- `ash.rollup_minute()` — incrementally rolls up new raw samples into `rollup_1m`
- `ash.rollup_hour()` — rolls minutes into hours, using a custom `_int4_array_cat_agg` / `_int8_array_cat_agg` to handle minutes with different-length wait/query arrays
- `ash.rollup_cleanup()` — enforces `rollup_1m_retention_days` (default 30) and `rollup_1h_retention_days` (default 1825 = ~5 years)

New rollup readers expose the data: `ash.minute_waits`, `ash.minute_waits_at`, `ash.hourly_queries`, `ash.hourly_queries_at`, `ash.daily_peak_backends`, `ash.daily_peak_backends_at`.

`ash.start()` schedules `rollup_minute` (every minute), `rollup_hour` (every hour), and `rollup_cleanup` (daily at 3am) alongside the sampler when pg_cron is available.

### Configurable N partitions

`ash.config.num_partitions` is now configurable in `[3, 32]`. Default is 3 (unchanged). `ash.rebuild_partitions(N, 'yes')` rebuilds the raw `sample_*` and `query_map_*` partition tables; `take_sample()` and `rotate()` use dynamic SQL that walks `num_partitions` instead of the hardcoded 3.

### Privilege hardening (REVOKE from PUBLIC)

Every reader function gets a `SET search_path = pg_catalog, ash, public[, <pgss_schema>]` guard that resists shadow attacks via session search_path. Every `ash.*` function has `EXECUTE` revoked from `PUBLIC`; every reader table has `SELECT` revoked. Helpers `ash._pgss_schema()` and `ash._apply_pgss_search_path()` detect the schema where `pg_stat_statements` lives and fold it into the search_path of pgss-aware readers. Hardcoded utilities (`ash.epoch()`, `ash.ts_from_timestamptz()`, `ash.ts_to_timestamptz()`) are re-granted to `PUBLIC` since they don't access sample data. ([PR #45](https://github.com/NikolayS/pg_ash/pull/45))

#### Privilege provisioning helpers

`ash.grant_reader(role)` and `ash.revoke_reader(role)` provision a monitoring role (Grafana, Datadog, etc.) with the minimum privileges to call every public reader. Owner-only, idempotent, symmetric undo. (issue #52; [PR #60](https://github.com/NikolayS/pg_ash/pull/60))

```sql
create role grafana login;
select ash.grant_reader('grafana');
-- ...later
select ash.revoke_reader('grafana');
```

The admin function set is centralized in `ash._admin_funcs()` — a single source of truth for the REVOKE-from-PUBLIC hardening block and the grant/revoke helpers. (issue #67; [PR #71](https://github.com/NikolayS/pg_ash/pull/71))

> **Note:** After `ash.rebuild_partitions(N, 'yes')`, previously-granted reader roles lose access to the new partition tables. Re-run `ash.grant_reader(...)` for each monitoring role.

### Decoded-sample convenience overloads

`ash.decode_sample(p_sample_ts int4)` and `ash.decode_sample_at(p_ts timestamptz)` decode every row at a given timestamp without requiring the caller to fetch the packed `data` array first. The original `decode_sample(integer[], smallint)` is unchanged. (issue #54; [PR #58](https://github.com/NikolayS/pg_ash/pull/58))

### NOTICE on out-of-window queries (relative AND absolute)

When the requested time range falls outside the retained window (older than `2 * rotation_period`, or in the future), readers emit a `NOTICE` and return empty:

- Relative-interval readers (`top_waits`, `top_queries`, etc.) — via `ash._active_slots_for(p_interval)`
- Absolute-time `_at` readers (`top_waits_at`, `samples_at`, etc.) — via the new `ash._active_slots_for_at(p_start, p_end)` helper, mirroring the relative-interval behavior. (issue #69; [PR #72](https://github.com/NikolayS/pg_ash/pull/72))

### New observability counters

Three new bigint columns on `ash.config`, all surfaced by `ash.status()`:

- `missed_samples` — bumped when `take_sample()` catches `query_canceled` (statement_timeout or pg_cancel_backend). The sampler emits a `WARNING` and returns `-1` so callers can observe the miss. (issues #27 and #28; [PR #41](https://github.com/NikolayS/pg_ash/pull/41))
- `insert_errors` — bumped when `take_sample()`'s inner `EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS` swallows a non-cancel insert error instead of silently dropping data. (M-BUG-4)
- `register_wait_cap_hits` — bumped when `_register_wait` skips a new `(state, type, event)` because `wait_event_map` has hit its 32 000-row cap. Counter reveals silently-dropped wait registrations. (M-BUG-6 / H-SEC-3)

`status()` also reports `epoch_seconds_remaining` and the year-2094 horizon when `sample_ts` (int4 epoch offset) overflows — sampling hard-fails with `integer out of range` past that point, NOT silently wraps. (issue #37)

### Misc

- `sampling_enabled` flag and `skipped_samples` counter on `ash.config`
- `ts_from_timestamptz()` / `ts_to_timestamptz()` epoch ↔ int4 helpers
- `start()` validates the interval shape before branching on pg_cron availability, re-syncs `cron.job.schedule` on re-invocation, and defends against malformed `pg_cron` extversion strings (H-BUG-1, H-BUG-2, M-BUG-8)
- Pre-truncation rollup in `rotate()` so the slot we're about to discard contributes to `rollup_1m` first
- Advisory lock protocol around `take_sample()` ↔ `rotate()` to prevent overlapping samples landing in a slot mid-rotation
- Documented the advisory-lock squat DoS limitation and mitigation in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#advisory-lock-squat-dos)

## Fixes

- **No more `integer out of range` on absurd reader inputs.** Both the relative-interval readers (`top_waits('1000 years')`, etc.) and the absolute-timestamp `_at` readers (`top_waits_at('1000-01-01', …)`, etc.) now return empty rows cleanly via clamps in the readers and in `ts_from_timestamptz`. (issues #51 and #63; [PR #57](https://github.com/NikolayS/pg_ash/pull/57), [PR #65](https://github.com/NikolayS/pg_ash/pull/65))
- **`sample_data_check` constraint aligned across upgrade paths.** Installs upgraded from 1.0 had a looser `array_length(data, 1) >= 2` check that 1.1 silently failed to tighten because of `create table if not exists`. An idempotent DO block in install.sql now drops + re-adds the `>= 3` form. (issue #49; [PR #56](https://github.com/NikolayS/pg_ash/pull/56))
- **`ash.status()` no longer errors for non-superuser monitoring roles when pg_cron is loaded.** A nested `EXCEPTION WHEN insufficient_privilege` substitutes a fallback row pointing at the missing `GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA cron`. (issue #61; [PR #62](https://github.com/NikolayS/pg_ash/pull/62))

## CI / infra

- End-to-end pg_cron firing test passes on every PG 14–18 cron-enabled job. Provisions a `root` PG role + database to satisfy peer auth in the GHA service container; asserts via `ash.sample` row growth with a real `pg_sleep` workload. (issue #46; [PR #73](https://github.com/NikolayS/pg_ash/pull/73))
- Schema-equivalence CI now diffs `pg_constraint` between fresh-install and chain-upgrade snapshots — catches the class of divergence behind issue #49. (issue #66; [PR #70](https://github.com/NikolayS/pg_ash/pull/70))
- **Hot-path perf** improvements in `query_waits` / `query_waits_at` (window-based dedup via `named_hits` CTE), `rotate()` (single-statement `truncate ash.sample_N, ash.query_map_N restart identity`), and the `query_map` cap probe (`offset 49999 limit 1` replacing stale `pg_class.reltuples`). ([PR #42](https://github.com/NikolayS/pg_ash/pull/42))
- **Supply-chain hardening** for CI: third-party actions pinned to 40-char commit SHAs and least-privilege `permissions:` blocks. ([PR #40](https://github.com/NikolayS/pg_ash/pull/40))

## Demo

README's hero visual is a [short animated GIF](demos/) of pg_ash investigating a row-lock spike on Postgres 18. Reproducible via `make -C demos record`. Human-paced typing, colored bar charts, vanilla psql in tmux. ([PR #64](https://github.com/NikolayS/pg_ash/pull/64), [PR #68](https://github.com/NikolayS/pg_ash/pull/68))

# pg_ash 1.3 release notes

32 commits since v1.2. Upgrade from 1.2: `\i sql/ash-1.2-to-1.3.sql`. Fresh install or upgrade from any version: `\i sql/ash-install.sql`.

## What changed

### New: pg_cron now optional

`ash.start()` works without pg_cron — records the interval and prints `NOTICE` instructions for external scheduling (system cron, systemd timer, psql `\watch`, Python loop). `ash.stop()` reminds you to stop your external scheduler. `ash.status()` shows `no (use external scheduler)` when pg_cron is absent. (#7)

### New: set_debug_logging()

`ash.set_debug_logging(true)` enables per-session `RAISE LOG` in `take_sample()` — each sampled backend emits a log line with pid, state, wait event, backend type, and query_id. Useful for diagnosing connection pooler behavior. Goes to server log only, independent of `client_min_messages`. (#8, refs #4)

### New: pgss-dependent functions fail fast

`top_queries_with_text()`, `event_queries()`, and `event_queries_at()` now raise a clear `EXCEPTION` with a `HINT` when `pg_stat_statements` is not installed, instead of silently returning NULLs. (#14, refs #10)

### New: pgss-optional functions warn

`top_queries()`, `top_queries_at()`, `samples()`, and `samples_at()` emit a `WARNING` when `pg_stat_statements` is missing — query_text returns NULL but the function still returns sample data. (#17)

### Fixed: Azure compatibility

`cron.alter_job()` API used instead of direct `UPDATE cron.job` — works on Azure Flexible Server where the table is read-only. Nodename update skipped when unnecessary (background workers mode or socket connection). (#6, fixes #3)

### Fixed: minute and hour intervals

`ash.start('5 minutes')` and `ash.start('6 hours')` now work. Sub-minute still requires pg_cron ≥ 1.5. Non-round intervals (e.g. 90 seconds) and intervals exceeding 23 hours are rejected with clear errors. (fixes #2)

### Fixed: Azure pg_cron version strings

pg_cron version `'4-1'` (Azure format) is now parsed correctly via `regexp_replace`. Previously caused a version check failure.

### Improved: take_sample() optimization

Removed `DISTINCT` from the Read 1 `pg_stat_activity` scan. Wait event dedup uses an in-memory `text[]` seen-set instead of per-row existence checks. (#8)

### Improved: schema parity

Upgrade script (`ash-1.2-to-1.3.sql`) re-creates all 38 functions, ensuring identical function bodies between fresh install and upgrade path. CI schema equivalence test validates this on every push. (#9, #13)

### Improved: CI

PG18 added to standard test matrix (dropped pgxn-tools workaround). `pg_stat_statements` loaded in CI for pgss-dependent testing. Degraded mode tests (without pgss, without pg_cron). Shell-level `WARNING` verification via stderr capture. SQL keywords lowercased in test file. (#14, #15, #17, #18)

## Functions (38 total)

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `set_debug_logging(bool)` | **New** — enable/disable per-session RAISE LOG in take_sample() |

All other functions unchanged from 1.2. See README for the full reference.

# pg_ash 1.2 release notes

51 commits since v1.1. Upgrade from 1.1: `\i sql/ash-1.1-to-1.2.sql`. Fresh install or upgrade from any version: `\i sql/ash-install.sql`.

## What changed

### New: event_queries

`event_queries()` and `event_queries_at()` — find which queries are responsible for a specific wait event. Flexible matching: `'Lock:tuple'` (exact event), `'IO'` (all events of a type), or `'CPU*'` (synthetic). Includes bar column.

```sql
-- which queries are causing Lock:tuple?
select * from ash.event_queries('Lock:tuple', '1 hour');

-- all IO-related queries in a time window
select * from ash.event_queries_at('IO', '2026-02-17 14:00', '2026-02-17 14:05');
```

### New: session-level color toggle

Enable ANSI colors for the whole session without passing `p_color` to every call:

```sql
set ash.color = on;
select * from ash.top_waits('1 hour');
select * from ash.timeline_chart('1 hour');
```

Uses a custom GUC — works on any Postgres 9.2+ without `postgresql.conf` changes. `ash.status()` now shows the current color state.

### New: bar visualization on all wait-showing functions

Every function that shows `pct` now has a `bar` column — `query_waits`, `top_by_type`, `event_queries` (plus all `_at` variants). Bar width controlled by `p_width` (default 20), colors by `p_color` or `set ash.color = on`.

### Changed: waits_by_type renamed to top_by_type

Consistent naming with `top_waits`, `top_queries`. The old name is dropped on install/upgrade.

### Changed: top_queries_with_text columns

`mean_time_ms` renamed to `mean_exec_time_ms`. New column `total_exec_time_ms` added.

### Improved: pspg-compatible bar alignment

ANSI color escapes are zero-padded to uniform 19-byte length (`\033[38;2;080;250;123m` not `\033[38;2;80;250;123m`). The `_bar()` helper pads the full bar string to a fixed raw byte length, preventing right-border misalignment in pspg and similar tools.

### Improved: timeline_chart shows empty buckets

Quiet periods now show rows with `active = 0` instead of being omitted, so you can see the full time range.

### Improved: observer-effect protection

The sampler pg_cron command now includes `SET statement_timeout = '500ms'` to prevent `take_sample()` from becoming a problem on overloaded servers. The 500ms cap gives 10× headroom over normal ~50ms execution. Existing cron jobs are updated automatically on upgrade.

### Improved: version tracking

`ash.config` now has a `version` column. `ash.status()` shows it as the first metric. The install and migration files set it automatically.

### Improved: dynamic overload cleanup

`ash-install.sql` discovers and drops all stale function overloads by name, making it safe to run on any prior version without "function is not unique" errors.

### Fixed: event_queries crash without pg_stat_statements

Both `event_queries()` and `event_queries_at()` would crash on Postgres instances without `pg_stat_statements` loaded — the table reference was validated at plan time even in the `false` branch. Split into two `RETURN QUERY` branches.

### Fixed: IdleTx color in top_by_type

`top_by_type()` passed `'IdleTx:*'` to `_wait_color()` which used exact match. Changed to `LIKE 'IdleTx%'`.

### Fixed: upgrade path completeness

`start()` and `status()` are now re-created in the 1.1→1.2 migration, ensuring upgraded installs get the statement_timeout protection and color/version metrics.

### Security: admin functions restricted

`start()`, `stop()`, `uninstall()`, `rotate()`, and `take_sample()` are now `REVOKE`d from PUBLIC and `GRANT`ed only to the schema owner. Reader functions remain PUBLIC.

### Security: uninstall confirmation guard

`ash.uninstall()` now requires a confirmation parameter: `ash.uninstall('yes')`. Calling without the argument raises an error with usage instructions.

### Fixed: status() missing SET jit = off

`status()` was the only reader function without JIT protection. Fixed.

## Functions (37 total)

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `event_queries(event, interval, limit, width, color)` | **New** — top queries for a wait event |
| `event_queries_at(event, start, end, limit, width, color)` | **New** — absolute-time variant |
| `_bar(event, pct, max_pct, width, color)` | **New** — shared bar rendering helper |
| `_color_on(color)` | **New** — resolve effective color state (param or session GUC) |
| `top_by_type(interval, width, color)` | **Renamed** from `waits_by_type` — now with bar |
| `top_by_type_at(start, end, width, color)` | **Renamed** from `waits_by_type_at` — now with bar |
| `query_waits(query_id, interval, width, color)` | **Enhanced** — added bar column |
| `query_waits_at(query_id, start, end, width, color)` | **Enhanced** — added bar column |
| `top_queries_with_text(interval, limit)` | **Enhanced** — renamed/added columns |
| `start(interval)` | **Enhanced** — statement_timeout in cron command |
| `status()` | **Enhanced** — shows version, color state |

All other functions unchanged from 1.1. See README for the full reference.

# pg_ash 1.1 release notes

Upgrade from 1.0: `\i sql/ash-1.1.sql` — safe to run on top of a running 1.0 installation.

## What changed

### New: timeline chart

`timeline_chart()` and `timeline_chart_at()` — stacked bar chart of wait events over time, showing average active sessions per bucket. Each rank gets a distinct character — `█` (rank 1), `▓` (rank 2), `░` (rank 3), `▒` (rank 4+), `·` (Other) — so the breakdown is visible without color. ANSI colors are available as an experimental feature via `p_color => true` — green = CPU\*, blue = IO, red = Lock, pink = LWLock, cyan = IPC, yellow = Client, orange = Timeout, teal = BufferPin, purple = Activity, light purple = Extension, light yellow = IdleTx. Colors are aligned with PostgresAI monitoring. Note: psql's table formatter escapes ANSI codes; colors work in pgcli, DataGrip, unaligned mode, or piped output.

```sql
select * from ash.timeline_chart('1 hour', '5 minutes');
select * from ash.timeline_chart_at('2026-02-14 19:50', '2026-02-14 20:10', '1 minute', 5, 50);
```

Output: 4 columns — `bucket_start | active | detail | chart`. First row is a legend. `p_top` controls how many events get individual bars (the rest roll into "Other"). Default `p_top = 3`.

### Changed: histogram folded into top_waits

`histogram()` and `histogram_at()` removed. The `bar` column is now part of `top_waits()` and `top_waits_at()`, controlled by the `p_width` parameter (default 40). Same visualization, fewer functions.

### Changed: ANSI colors (experimental, off by default)

Color scheme aligned with PostgresAI monitoring: green = CPU\*, blue = IO, red = Lock, pink = LWLock, cyan = IPC, yellow = Client, orange = Timeout, teal = BufferPin, purple = Activity, light purple = Extension, light yellow = IdleTx. All colors use 24-bit RGB escape codes for consistent rendering across terminal themes.

### Fixed: pg_cron version comparison

Version check now uses `string_to_array()::int[]` comparison instead of lexicographic string comparison. The old code would incorrectly reject pg_cron 1.10+.

### Fixed: check constraint tightened

Minimum valid encoded array is 3 elements (`[-wid, count, qid]`), not 2. The CHECK constraint and sampler guard now enforce `array_length >= 3`.

### Improved: 100% test coverage

CI expanded from 16 assertions to 151. All 32 functions are directly tested across Postgres 14–18.

## Functions (32 total)

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `timeline_chart(interval, bucket, top, width, color)` | **New** — stacked bar chart (ANSI colors opt-in) |
| `timeline_chart_at(start, end, bucket, top, width)` | **New** — absolute-time variant |
| `_wait_color(event, color)` | **New** — ANSI color mapper (experimental) |

# pg_ash 1.0 release notes

The first release of pg_ash — active session history for Postgres.

## What it does

pg_ash samples `pg_stat_activity` every second via pg_cron and stores wait events, query IDs, and session state in a compact encoded format. The data is queryable with plain SQL through 17 built-in reader functions covering daily review, incident investigation, and trend analysis.

## Design philosophy

**The anti-extension.** pg_ash is pure SQL + PL/pgSQL — no C code, no `shared_preload_libraries`, no restart required. Install with `\i sql/ash-1.0.sql` on any Postgres 14+ instance with pg_cron 1.5+, including managed providers: RDS, Cloud SQL, AlloyDB, Supabase, Neon.

Key design decisions:

- **Skytools PGQ-style 3-partition ring buffer** — TRUNCATE-based rotation, zero bloat, zero vacuum overhead on sample data
- **Partitioned query_map** — three per-partition dictionary tables that TRUNCATE in lockstep with sample partitions, eliminating all GC logic
- **Encoded integer arrays** — wait events and query IDs packed into `integer[]` columns (~106 bytes per row for 6 active backends), with TOAST LZ4 compression
- **Inline SQL decode** — reader functions use `generate_subscripts` and array subscript access instead of plpgsql loops, achieving ~30 ms response times on 1-hour windows
- **Per-function `set jit = off`** — prevents 10x overhead from JIT compilation on OLTP servers without affecting other workloads

## Reader functions

17 functions organized into relative-time (interval) and absolute-time (timestamptz range) variants:

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `top_waits(interval, limit)` | Top wait events with "Other" rollup row |
| `top_queries(interval, limit)` | Top queries by wait sample count |
| `top_queries_with_text(interval, limit)` | Same, with query text from pg_stat_statements |
| `query_waits(query_id, interval)` | Wait event profile for a specific query |
| `waits_by_type(interval)` | Wait event type distribution |
| `wait_timeline(interval, bucket)` | Time-bucketed wait event breakdown |
| `samples_by_database(interval)` | Per-database sample counts |
| `activity_summary(interval)` | One-call overview — peak backends, top waits, top queries |
| `histogram(interval, limit, width)` | Visual bar chart of wait event distribution |
| `samples(interval, limit)` | Fully decoded raw sample browser |

Absolute-time variants (`_at` suffix): `top_waits_at`, `top_queries_at`, `query_waits_at`, `waits_by_type_at`, `wait_timeline_at`, `histogram_at`, `samples_at`.

## Lifecycle functions

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `start(interval)` | Start sampling — creates pg_cron jobs |
| `stop()` | Stop sampling — removes pg_cron jobs |
| `status()` | Show configuration, slot state, and storage metrics |
| `uninstall()` | Stop sampling and drop the ash schema |

## Storage characteristics

Measured with representative workloads (see [benchmarks](https://github.com/NikolayS/pg_ash/issues/1)):

- **Row size:** ~106 bytes for 6 active backends (measured with `pg_column_size`)
- **Daily storage:** ~30 MiB for typical workloads at 1-second sampling
- **Production max:** ~60 MiB active (2 partitions x 30 MiB/day for 50 backends)
- **WAL:** ~29 KiB per sample steady state (~2.4 GiB/day), dominated by full-page writes

## Encoding format

Each sample row contains an `integer[]` column with the format:

```
[-wait_id, count, qid, qid, ..., -next_wait_id, count, qid, ...]
```

Negative values are wait event dictionary IDs (markers), followed by a backend count, then query_map IDs for each backend in that wait state. The encoding version is tracked in `ash.config.encoding_version`.

## Synthetic wait types

- **`CPU*`** — active backend with no wait event reported. The asterisk signals ambiguity: either genuine CPU work or an uninstrumented code path. See [gaps.wait.events](https://gaps.wait.events) for details.
- **`IdleTx`** — idle-in-transaction backend with no wait event. These hold locks and block vacuum — always sampled.

## Requirements

- Postgres 14+ (requires `query_id` in `pg_stat_activity`)
- pg_cron 1.5+ for sub-minute scheduling (most managed providers ship this)
- Optional: pg_stat_statements for `top_queries_with_text()`
- `compute_query_id = on` (default since Postgres 14)

## Schema

All objects live in the `ash` schema:

- `ash.config` — singleton configuration table
- `ash.wait_event_map` — wait event dictionary (~600 entries max)
- `ash.query_map_0`, `query_map_1`, `query_map_2` — per-partition query ID dictionaries
- `ash.query_map_all` — unified view (planner eliminates non-matching partitions)
- `ash.sample` — partitioned sample table (3 partitions, ring buffer)
- Indexes on `sample_ts` per partition for time-range queries

## Design documents

Detailed design blueprints are in the [`blueprints/`](blueprints/) directory:

- **[SPEC.md](blueprints/SPEC.md)** — full specification: goals, problem statement, design decisions, encoding format, sampling strategy
- **[STORAGE_BRAINSTORM.md](blueprints/STORAGE_BRAINSTORM.md)** — storage format benchmarks comparing 8 approaches (flat rows, JSONB, hstore, `smallint[]`, `integer[]`, and more) with measured bytes/row on Postgres 17
- **[PARTITIONED_QUERYMAP_DESIGN.md](blueprints/PARTITIONED_QUERYMAP_DESIGN.md)** — per-partition query_map design: why single-table GC was replaced with lockstep TRUNCATE, edge cases, trade-offs
- **[ROLLUP_DESIGN.md](blueprints/ROLLUP_DESIGN.md)** — two-level aggregation design (per-minute 30-day, per-hour 5-year) for long-term trend analysis — planned for v1.1

Benchmark results are published in [issue #1](https://github.com/NikolayS/pg_ash/issues/1).

## What is not in 1.0

- **Rollup tables** — per-minute and per-hour aggregation for long-term trends (designed in `blueprints/ROLLUP_DESIGN.md`, implementation planned for 1.1)
- **Cross-database query text** — sampling covers all databases (via `pg_stat_activity.datid`), but `top_queries_with_text()` can only resolve query text from pg_stat_statements in the database where pg_ash is installed
- **Parallel query attribution** — parallel workers are sampled but not linked to their leader
